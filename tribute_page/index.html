                <p>Gustav Elijah Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), 
                    known professionally as Lil Peep (often stylized as LiL PEEP),
                    was an American rapper, singer, songwriter and model. 
                    He was a member of the emo rap collective GothBoiClique. 
                    Helping pioneer an emo revival style of rap and rock music, 
                    Lil Peep has been credited as the leading figure of the mid–late 2010s 
                    emo rap scene and came to be an inspiration to outcasts and youth subcultures.
                    Lil Peep had substance abuse issues due to his mental health conditions, 
                    including depression and bipolar disorder, which often influenced the thematic content 
                    of his music. On the day of a scheduled performance at a Tucson, 
                    Arizona venue on November 15, 2017, two weeks after his 21st birthday, he died. 
                    The Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner certified the cause of death as an 
                    accidental overdose of fentanyl and Xanax.</p>
